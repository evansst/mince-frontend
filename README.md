## About Mince
Mince is a full-stack web application that pulls from over 5,000 existing recipes through the utilization of RESTful APIs. Users can type in a certain type of dish they are looking for such as "chicken" and be taken to all the chicken recipes available. If logged in, the user can also create a list of their favorite recipes and shopping list! When they are ready to make the meal, users have the option of viewing the entire recipe guide for step-by-step guidance.
